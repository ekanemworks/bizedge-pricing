                    <b>4. Our Role</b> 
                    <br>(i) When you use the features of the App outside the United States of America, we are acting as your agent to assist you in concluding the purchase of goods or services from participating merchants. When you use the features of the App within the United States of America, we are not acting as your agent or trustee but as agent for the participating merchants to process payments made by you. In all circumstances when you purchase goods or services from participating merchants, the contract for the sale of those goods or services will be between you and the merchant.
                    <br>(ii) You understand and agree that the Company shall not be responsible for the outcome of your transactions with external merchants via the App. We do not have control, nor shall we be liable for, the legality of, or the use of, the goods and services that are paid for using the App.
                    <br>(iii) It is the responsibility of you and the relevant merchant, not us, to resolve any dispute or claim raised by you relating to any payments made via the App or the purchase or sale of goods or services you (a Customer Claim). We may, however, initiate a refund if (a) a payment made via the App is reversed by a court, regulatory authority or other third party acting in accordance with applicable law, (b) we, in our sole and absolute discretion, accept or have reason to believe that a payment was not authorized by you, or (c) a payment is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in breach of this Agreement. Where you have a dispute with a merchant, we will provide information we hold which may assist resolution and otherwise attempt to assist you as far as we consider practicable. We may charge you an administration fee to cover our reasonable costs of providing any such assistance.

                    <b>5. Security and Unauthorized Payments</b> 
                    <br>(i) The App gives you the opportunity to choose a password to authorize a payment (the Password).
                    <br>(ii) As long as the correct Password is entered (or if you elect not to use a Password), we will assume that you are the person giving instructions and making payments and you will be liable for them, except to the extent provided for in section 11(ii). You must therefore choose a secure Password that is not easily guessed by another person, keep the Password secret and make sure that it is not stored in a way that enables others to access it or impersonate you. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, if you disclose the Password to any person whom you authorise to access the App, you are also responsible and liable for any access, use, misuse or disclosure of your Password by such person.
                    <br>(iii) We may also use facial recognition technology for payment verification and fraud prevention purposes.
                    <br>(iv) If you become aware of a payment being made via the App that was not authorised by you (an Unauthorised Payment) or if you lose the device on which the App is installed, disclose your Password to a person unauthorised by you, or believe that someone else can use the App by impersonating you, you should inform us immediately by emailing support@bizedge.com and we will disable the payments feature of the App until you re-enter your payment card details in the Payment Methods section of the App. Unless and until you provide such notice:
                    <br>(a) you will be responsible for any instruction which we receive and act on, even if it was not given by you; and
                    <br>(b) we will not be responsible for any unauthorised access to confidential information about you in the App.
                    <br>(v) We can refuse to act on any instruction including where we believe an instruction: 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) was unclear; 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) was not given by you; or 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) might cause us to breach a legal or other duty; 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) if we believe the App is being used for an illegal purpose; or 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) may harm our reputation.
                    <br>(vi) You agree to fully cooperate with us, our agents, regulatory authorities and the police where you or we suspect there have been Unauthorised Payments in respect of the App.
