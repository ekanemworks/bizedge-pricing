                <br>Lawful grounds for processing (for individuals located in the EEA or the UK)
                <br>If you are an individual residing in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”) we can only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful ground to do so. Depending on the processing activity, we can process your Personal Data on the following grounds:
                <br>1. In order to comply with our obligations under an agreement we concluded with you, such as to provide our Services;
                <br>2. Where you have freely given your explicit consent and this consent has not been revoked;
                <br>3. Where we are pursuing a legitimate interest, which is not outweighed by your fundamental rights or freedoms; or
                <br>4. Pursuant to a legal obligation under EU law or the law of a member state of the EU; or
                <br>5. In very exceptional cases to protect your vital interests.
                <br><br>B. Do we disclose your Personal Data?
                <br>We will only share your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In the following circumstances, we may share your Personal Data with third parties.
                <br>Information that we share with affiliated companies
                <br><br>Biz Edge is a global company with affiliates all over the world. To do business globally and help improve the Services provided, Biz Edge may share Visitor, Partner, and Customer Personal Data with its affiliates. Some of these affiliated companies may be located outside the EEA or the UK. In this case, Biz Edge will ensure an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data transferred outside the EEA or the UK.
                <br>Information that we share with third parties
                <br><br><b>Service providers</b>: We engage third-party service providers (companies operating on our behalf) to help us administer, provide and improve the Services and the Websites. We share Personal Data with these third-party service providers to enable them to provide these services for us. Due to our continuous efforts to improve our Websites and Services, our third-party service providers may change periodically. As an example, we engage with third parties who provide data storage solutions, data security tools, and information management services. Some of these third-party service providers may be located outside the EEA or the UK. If this is the case, we will provide for an adequate level of protection regarding Personal Data. Otherwise, we will only share Personal Data at your direction and according to this Privacy Policy.
                <br><br><b>Integration Partners:</b> Customers may choose to connect the Services to the services of one of our many integration Partners for added functionality. By setting up these connections, you allow Biz Edge to share certain information with these integration Partners.
                <br><br><b>Linking third parties:</b> If you arrived at our Website via a link from a third-party website or application (“Linking Third Party”), we may collect a unique code related to that Linking Third Party. This will help us identify how you arrived at our Website. Once on our Website, if you become a Customer or submit Personal Data to us for another reason (i.e. for marketing purposes, to sign up for a product trial or demo), we may inform the Linking Third Party that a Visitor originating on their website or application has become a Biz Edge lead (Customer or potential Customer). Any collection or use of your Personal Data by the Linking Third-Party is subject to the privacy policy of the Linking Third Party.
                <br>Non-Personally Identifiable Information
                <br>In order to provide and improve our Services, we may use and disclose to third parties (for example, our service providers and analytics Partners) non-personally identifiable information which we collect, including cookie data and Log Data. This may include Personal Data which has been aggregated and de-identified in such a way that the data cannot be reidentified. We retain the right to use, at our reasonable discretion, any information, in any form, about more than one individual where the identity of the individuals is not known and cannot be inferred.
                <br><br><b>Social Network Sharing</b>
                <br>When you use any social network sharing function in connection with the Services (for example, sharing on Facebook), your sharing activity will be processed through a third party’s site or service. These third-party privacy policies, not ours, govern the collection and use of the information collected on those sites or networks, including Personal Data.
                <br>User-Generated Content (UGC) and Feedback
                <br>Some parts of our Websites and Services may allow Visitors and Customers to submit and view UGC. UGC includes such things as posting a question, an answer or a blog post. When you post UGC, other Visitors or Customers will be able to see certain information about you, such as your username or handle. You should be aware that any Personal Data you submit in UGC can be read, collected, distributed or used by other Visitors or Customers and could be used by third parties to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Data you choose to include in the UGC you provide through the Websites or Services.
                <br>If you complete surveys or provide us with feedback in any other form, we may use this information for our own business purposes, including for marketing and to improve our products and Services.
                <br>Protecting Ourselves and our Customers
                <br>We may release Personal Data when we believe that doing so is appropriate to comply with applicable laws, regulations or legal requests; to enforce or apply our policies and guidelines; to initiate, render, bill, and collect amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property; to protect the safety of our Customers; to address fraud, security or technical issues; to prevent or stop activity that we consider to be illegal or unethical; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we may also be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
                <br><br><b>Sale/Merger</b>
                <br>Information about our Customers and Partners is a business asset of Biz Edge. Consequently, information about our Customers and Partners, including Personal Data, may be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition involving Biz Edge, the creation of a separate business to provide some or all of the Services, the sale or pledge of Biz Edge’s assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.
                <br><br>C. What Kinds of Personal Data have we Disclosed?
                <br>Within the last twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Data. We have done so for one of the valid business purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
                <br>Category of Personal Data
                <br>First and last name
                <br>Contact information (email address, phone number, home or business address)

                <br>Date of birth
                <br>IP address

                <br>Credit bureau rating and reports
                <br><br>D. Do we sell your Personal Data? (For individuals located in California only)
                <br>Biz Edge does not sell Personal Data within the meaning of applicable laws. However, Biz Edge may sell non-personally identifiable information that has been derived from aggregated and deidentified Personal Data, provided such information cannot be used to re-identify individual Visitors or Customers.
                <br><br>E. Automated decision-making and profiling (For individuals located in EEA and UK only)
                <br>We do not use automated decision-making. We use Google Analytics for profiling. For further information about our use of Google Analytics, see section II.B. above.
                <br><br><b class="MajorRomanNumbers">IV. How do we Protect your Personal Data?</b>
                <br>We treat your Personal Data as private, confidential information and we strive to ensure that Personal Data under our control, regardless of format, is protected and kept secure at all times. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or of storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot absolutely guarantee the protection of any information shared with us. In the event of an unauthorized loss or disclosure of Personal Data, Visitors, Partners, and Customers may be subject to a risk of harm resulting from such loss or disclosure. Depending on various factors, such as the type and amount of Personal Data disclosed, consequences for individuals could include changes to their credit bureau rating or financial situation or identity theft. Biz Edge will at all times comply with applicable laws concerning data breach notification requirements and will endeavor to mitigate any risks of residual harm to the affected individuals.
                <br><br>A. Location of Personal Data
                <br>Your Personal Data may be stored on servers located in a country other than where you reside or do business. Please refer to this webpage for our list of service providers (sub-processors) and their established location. Personal Data may be subject to the local laws of the jurisdictions within which it is collected, used, disclosed and/or stored, and may be accessed by governmental authorities and law enforcement agencies in those jurisdictions. When the data concerns Personal Data of data subjects from the EEA or the UK, we will provide for an adequate level of protection of this data.
                <br><br>B. Retention of Personal Data
                <br>Biz Edge retains your Personal Data for as long as it is reasonably needed to deliver the Services. The retention terms can be longer if we are required to keep Personal Data longer on the basis of applicable law or to administer our business. Where you have the right to request deletion, we will delete your Personal Data in accordance with and upon receipt of written instructions from you to this effect, unless we are legally required to keep it. You may choose to do this in the event you terminate your agreement for the Services. If deletion is not possible, we will de-identify it in a way that cannot be reversed. If de-identification is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data 9 has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
                <br><br>C. International Data Transfers
                <br>We may transfer to, and store the data we collect about you in, countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected, including the United States, Canada or other destinations outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the United Kingdom (“UK”). Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the data. However, when we transfer your data to other countries, we will protect the data as described in this Privacy Policy and comply with applicable legal requirements for the transfer of data to third countries outside the EEA or the UK.
                <br>If you are located in the EEA or the UK, we will only transfer your personal data if the country to which the personal data will be transferred has been granted a European Commission adequacy decision, or if we have put in place an appropriate transfer mechanism and appropriate safeguards with any recipient or sub-processor, such as Standard Contractual Clauses as adopted by the European Commission or Data Processing Agreements ensuring an adequate level of data protection.
                <br><b>Privacy Shield?</b>
                <br>Even though the Privacy Shield is no longer a valid mechanism to transfer data out of the EU or Switzerland and into the US, Biz Edge remains Privacy Shield certified, and continues to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles and obligations.
                <br><br>Privacy Shield Principles

                <br>Accountability for Third Parties
                <br>We may transfer Personal Data to third parties for processing on our behalf. We will ensure that such data may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with the purposes for which such Personal Data was collected or the consent provided by you. In addition, any such third-party processor will process the data with the same level of protection as the protection provided by us including adherence to the data processing agreement executed with us to the extent it relates to Personal Data that is transferred from the EEA, the UK or Switzerland. We remain liable for any failure of the third party to do so unless we can prove that we are not responsible.

                <br>Right to Know about the Collection, Disclosure and Sale of Personal Data
                <br>You may ask us about what Personal Data we have collected about you and whether or not we have disclosed or sold such Personal Data to third parties.
                <br>Right to Access, Rectify, or Transfer your Personal Data
                <br>You have the right to access your Personal Data at any time and to receive a copy of the Personal Data undergoing processing. You can require us to correct or complete your Personal Data if it is not correct or complete. You can also ask us to provide your data in a commonly used electronic form.
                <br>Right to Object to Further Processing of your Personal Data
                <br>If we are processing your Personal Data on the basis of a legitimate interest, you may object to the processing activity. Upon receipt of an objection we will cease the processing activity for the future unless we can demonstrate a legitimate ground which overrides your interests, or that the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Please note that your exercise of this right may result in Biz Edge being unable to continue providing all or part of the Services to you.
                <br>Right to Deletion and to Restrict Processing of your Personal Data
                <br>If there is no longer a reason for us to process your Personal Data or if we don’t have a legal ground for the processing, you can require us to delete your Personal Data. We will take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may choose to de-identify your Personal Data instead of deleting it, provided we have a legitimate business reason for doing so. You can also require us to restrict the processing of your data if such processing is unlawful or if there is a dispute about the accuracy of the data.
                <br>Right to Non-Discrimination for Exercising your Rights
                <br>In the event you exercise one of the rights outlined in this section, Biz Edge will not discriminate against you for having done so.

Should Biz Edge consider selling Personal Data, we will only do so with your consent, and you will have the right to opt-out from the sale of your Personal Data by following the procedures outlined below. Biz Edge will wait a minimum of twelve (12) months after receiving your opt-out request before seeking authorization to sell your Personal Data again.
                <br>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (For individuals located in the EEA & UK only)
                <br>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the European Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that Biz Edge’s processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR. Please visit the website of the relevant supervisory authority for more information on how to submit such a complaint.

                C. Privacy Shield: Dispute Resolution
                If we are not able to resolve a complaint you have made in relation to our non-compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, you have the right to refer your complaint to JAMS which we designated as our independent recourse mechanism. Mediation will be conducted pursuant to JAMS International Mediation Rules. If you wish to file a claim please be referred to JAMS’ website for more information. This dispute resolution mechanism continues to apply despite the invalidation of the EU-U.S. and Switzerland-U.S. Privacy Shield as adequate mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the UK or Switzerland to the U.S.
                If the independent dispute resolution has not resolved your complaint, you have the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration. For more information about the process, we refer to Annex 1 to the Privacy Shield Principles.
